        <br>I enjoyed it soo much that I started watching many more and slowly I became vetaran.
        now I am at a point that I can tell you my to ten but sadly tokyoGhoul is not in it.
        <h2>My top ten</h2>
        <ol reversed id="ten">

            <li><h4>one piece</h4> <br><img src="onepiece.jpg"><br> see the thing is I didn't finish it thus it is in 9th maybr later it may move.</li>
            <li><h4>jujutsu kaisen</h4><br><img src="juju.jpg"><br> this is really good one with great art cant deny it's may go up since it only has two season.</li>
            <li><h4>mushoku tensei</h4><br><img src="musu.jpg"><br> if you ask me then i have to say this is peak isekai like no cap from art to story it is actually very good.</li>
            <li><h4>one punch man</h4><br><img src="OIP.jpg"><br>to be honest through out the anime world this is mc (saitama) is  one of the strongest character it is gag Character so sometimes it gets comedic give it go you will like it.</li>
            <li><h4>demon slayer</h4><br><img src="demon.jpg"><br> god what art work you wont believe with just few word you have to see it it is very unique it has a great character building with unfathomable story(I read manga so trust me).</li>
            <li><h4>black clover</h4><br><img src="blackBull.jpg"><br>most underrated one.Obviously it has very good animation but is story telling is :- this is a story of boy in magic world where every one can use magic except him.He also wants to be wizard king so humilation rivals and problem of life are boud to have but his determination is what keep him.</li>
            <li><h4>naruto</h4><br><img src="naru.jpg"><br>Naruto uzumaki now if you are already reading it you already know the emotions thing is this like telling how good you imginary crush is simply "Unexplainable" if some one doesn't watch naruto and he likes anime then it is like a sin for him.</li>
